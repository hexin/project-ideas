My private ideas for projects

* Create Google Chrome Browser plugin to make a Facebook's page called [Infopiguła](https://www.facebook.com/infopigula/) more readable. Probably, should open a new tab with nicely parsed news (single post) provided by the page.
* Resort booking and management system.
* Scrapper for programming jobs found on facebook groups.
